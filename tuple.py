#tuple is similar to list but it is "immutable"(we cant mak any changes in tuple)
# we will use round brackets when defining tuple.
marks = (95, 98, 97, 97, 97)
print(marks.count(97))   # it can count number of times an object is writtrn in a tuple. 
print(marks.index(98))   # can also tell index of that object in tuple.
# it is not necessary to put round bracket when defining tuple.
